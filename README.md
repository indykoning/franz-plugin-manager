# Franz Plugin Installer

Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/meetfranz/plugins/blob/master/docs/integration.md) for installation of this plugin.

## Requirements

Your system needs to have:
 * Git
 * NPM
 * NodeJs
 
 To function correctly.

Once you have placed this in it's correct folder you'll need to run `npm install` to download the dependencies

## Ideas
 * Build database of recipies using git repository or maybe crawling the Franz plugins page
 * If possible catch exceptions of franz not finding recipies and attempt to resolve the recipies
